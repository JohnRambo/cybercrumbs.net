> Hello World.
{% endhighlight %}

I am delighted to say that today is the day when I have decided to open up to the world. It's been a while I wanted to create a space where I could share what I do professionally (I am a web developer), but also my personal interests and thoughts. 

I am regularly impressed by how complex yet ingenuous human beings can be. Sometimes in ways that benefit us all, sometimes for the worst. The reason for this blog is to reflect on people and communities that inspire me. Hopefully, this will help me clarify my thoughts and shift my lifestyle in ways that are more consistent with my inner values.

<!-- Interests -->
As to whether or not you'll get anything valuable out of my posts depends on your interests. I'm very keen on Lean and Agile Web Development and I'm passionated about how clever use of technology can help communities raising new social movements and trends that impact society. 
I also love when people step back from their daily routine, take the time to look at the big picture and sort their lives out by removing clutter, and taking the steps to accomplish what they really care for. 
I feel this quest of simplicity could have tremendous beneficial impacts in our personal lives, but also in the way people run businesses, organisations and governments.

So you might see very diverse sorts of articles on this blog, ranging from purely technical with lots of code snippets (mainly `ruby` and frontend stuff), to spiritual thoughts and climate change advocacy.

<!-- Introducing myself -->
Oh sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Nicolas Wormser, 23 years old. I'm currently studying at the University of Technology in Troyes, France, while also working with the community-led social enterprise [Enspiral](http://enspiral.com), [Loomio](http://loomio.org) and other projects.

Side note: I might happen to write some posts in *Fran√ßais*, my native language, but my blog should allow to filter them out at some point.

Thanks for reading!
